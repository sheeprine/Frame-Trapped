Disclaimer:

-Roundhouse Ruffiankick hits only standing opponents or after a force stand like crouching Hard Punch, be aware of that!

-Most of the time you can chose between Fierce Criminal Upper for Damage oder forward Ruffian Kick for Spacecontrol

-After Roundhouse Ruffiankick you can Fadc Ultra 1

-Look at the Inputs if you are unsure what Button to use

-Stand as close as possible when using the COmbotrainer files, so as not to mess with the timing(Stand at reasonable range for jumpin combos)

Have fun and train hard!
